write a SQL query to find Cal Ripken Jr.’s salary history.

Sort by year in descending order.
Your query should return a table with two columns, one for year and one for salary.

SELECT year, salary FROM salaries
WHERE player_id = (
    SELECT id FROM players
    WHERE first_name = 'Cal' AND last_name = 'Ripken'
)
ORDER BY year DESC;
